Hello! I'm a third year double majoring in statistics and mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. I have experience working with data in R, Python, and Tableau on a variety of projects, including as a researcher in the Family and Culture Lab and as a data consultant with the Alameda County Food Bank.

Academically, I've completed coursework in statistics, probability, linear algebra, and analysis. I also worked on an independent reading project on convex polytopes and gave a talk on how to characterize the combinatorial structure of a hypercube in any dimension.

In addition, I'm a second degree karate black belt and an Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Music in piano performance. I also direct the international and business operations for Berkeley Model United Nations, the largest Model UN conference on the West Coast with 2,000+ delegates.

My long-term goals are to pursue graduate studies in statistics and to dive deeper into the data science field. Feel free to contact me with any professional, research, or academic opportunities at hubertluo@berkeley.edu.
