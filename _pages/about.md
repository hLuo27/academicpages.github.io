I'm a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying statistics and applied math. Currently, I'm working as a Data Science Intern at Lazard and conducting research with the Stark Group in the Statistics department at UC Berkeley. My interests are in applied statistics in connection with finance, political science, and demography.
