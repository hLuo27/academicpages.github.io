I'm currently a third year studying statistics and mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. I've worked on a number of projects, including as a researcher in the Family and Culture Lab and as a data science intern with WellDone, a NGO working to improve the reliability of hand pumps. I'm interested in probability theory, applied statistics, stochastic processes, and algebraic combinatorics.
