Hello! I'm a third year double majoring in statistics and mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. Currently, I'm an undergraduate researcher in the Family and Culture Lab, where I manage the data collected from a longitudinal study on childhood socio-emotional growth. I have experience with data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in R, Python, and Tableau.

Academically, I have completed an independent reading project on convex polytopes, a field that combines my interests in combinatorics and graph theory. I gave a talk on how to characterize the combinatorial structure of a hypercube and have taken a diverse range of coursework in linear algebra, statistical/probability theory, analysis, and computing.

Outside the academic world, I'm a second degree black belt in karate and an Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Music in piano performance. I also direct the international and business operations for Berkeley Model United Nations, the oldest and largest Model UN conference on the West Coast with 2,000+ delegates.

My long-term goals are to pursue graduate studies in statistics and to dive deeper into the data science field. Feel free to contact me with any professional, research, or academic opportunities at hubertluo@berkeley.edu.
