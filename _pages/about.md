I'm a third year at the University of California, Berkeley studying statistics and applied math with a specialization in data science. I'm currently conducting research in the Stark Group and I was previously a researcher in the Family and Culture Lab. I also have experience as a Data Science Intern with a non-profit and as a Data Consultant with the Statistics Students Association. I'm interested in applied statistics, probability theory, and sports analytics.
