I'm a fourth year at the University of California, Berkeley studying statistics and applied math. On campus, I'm a researcher in the Stark Group, a GSI for Data 8, and President of Berkeley Model United Nations. I will be returning to Lazard as a Data Scientist in 2020. My interests are in applied statistics in connection with finance and political science.
