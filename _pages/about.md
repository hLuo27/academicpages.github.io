I'm a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying statistics and applied math. On campus, I'm a researcher in the Stark Group, a GSI for Data 8, and part of Berkeley Model United Nations, an educational non-profit which organizes the oldest Model UN conference in the world and the largest on the west coast with 2,000+ delegates. 

I will be returning to Lazard as a Data Scientist in 2020 and my interests are in applied statistics in connection with finance and political science.
