I'm a third year studying statistics and mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and currently conducting research with the Stark Research Group in Statistics. I've also worked as a researcher in the Family and Culture Lab and as a Data Science Intern with WellDone, a non-profit using sensor technology to improve the reliability of hand pumps. I'm interested in applied statistics, probability theory, and stochastic processes.
