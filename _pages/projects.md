## Predicting Child Heights from Parent Heights
Python/Jupyter Notebook | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/predict_heights) | April 2018

- Fitted data using linear regression, applied method of least squares, calculated correlation, standardized data units, and graphed residuals to evaluate applicability of linear regression model to predict heights of children given the heights of their parents
- Python packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, datascience

## Location of Palindromes in DNA Sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/DNA_palindromes) | March 2018

- Tested whether whether the placements of palindromes in the DNA sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus follows a Poisson distribution using a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test on the counts of palindromes in various intervals and a hypothesis test on the maximum number of palindromes found in an interval.
- Wrote final report with visualizations and tables to analyze results and discuss limitations 
- R Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, knitr

## 2016-17 NBA Statistics 
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/nba) | February 2018 - March 2018

- Used Principal Component Analysis, bootstrap/jackknife resampling, and random sampling simulations to calculate sample statistics, standard errors, correlations, and confidence intervals
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, including dataframe manipulations and visualizations
- R Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, readr, bootstrap

## National Pokédex Data Analysis
Python/Jupyter Notebook | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/pokemon) | January 2018 - March 2018

- Simulate random sampling, clean datasets, and conduct exploratory data analysis, i.e., table manipulations, cross tabulations, grouping, and visualizations of all Pokémon from Generations 1-7
- Python packages: datascience, numpy, matplotlib

## Alameda County Food Insecurity
Berkeley Statistics Undergraduate Students Association Data Consultant | September 2017 - December 2017

- Analyzed social, economic, and demographic datasets to conduct exploratory data analysis and identify areas in need of hunger alleviation services
- Created multivariable predictive model to predict pounds unmet by census tract using Python and R
- Produced a variety of data visualizations including choropleth maps to present findings and investigate model accuracy using Tableau
- Conducted literature review, cleaned census data, and wrote final report and slides to develop future distribution and service strategies
