## Personal/Class Projects

### BrokenBat Baseball Simulator Draft Analysis
Python | [Report](https://github.com/hLuo27/broken_bat/blob/master/draft/draft_report.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/hLuo27/broken_bat/tree/master/draft) | December 2018
- Scraped player and team draft information
- Developed and evaluated machine learning models to predict a player's potential
- Analyzed draft patterns in 15 seasons and created report explaining findings with actionable items for managers to change draft strategies

### Neural Networks
Python | August 2018
- Built neural networks from scratch to implement handwritten digit classification, language classification, and regression models
- Tuned hyperparameters to achieve 97.5% accuracy on digit classification, 81% on language classification, and loss of 0.0077 on sine curve regression

### Pacman Agent
Python | June/July 2018
- Created collaborative agent that implemented A* search, minimax game trees, and reinforcement learning to play Pacman

### Classifying Legendary Pokémon
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/pokemon/blob/master/classify_legenday_pokemon_report.md) | May 2018

### Location of Palindromes in DNA Sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/DNA_palindromes/blob/master/dna_palindromes.md) | March 2018
- Tested whether the placements of palindromes in the DNA sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus follows a Poisson distribution using a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test on the counts of palindromes in various intervals and a hypothesis test on the maximum number of palindromes found in an interval.
- Wrote final report with visualizations and tables to analyze results and discuss limitations
