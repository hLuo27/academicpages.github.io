## Personal/Class Projects

### Pacman Agent
Python | June/July 2018
- Created collaborative agent that implemented A* search, minimax game trees, and reinforcement learning to play Pacman

### Classifying Legendary Pokémon
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/pokemon/blob/master/classify_legenday_pokemon_report.md) | May 2018
- Developed classifier to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary or not with 98.8% accuracy using k-means clustering 
- R Packages: dplyr, ggplot2

### Predicting Child Heights from Parent Heights
Python/Jupyter Notebook | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/predict_heights) | April 2018
- Fitted data using linear regression, applied method of least squares, calculated correlation, standardized data units, and graphed residuals to evaluate applicability of linear regression model to predict heights of children given the heights of their parents
- Python packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, datascience

### Location of Palindromes in DNA Sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/DNA_palindromes) | March 2018
- Tested whether the placements of palindromes in the DNA sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus follows a Poisson distribution using a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test on the counts of palindromes in various intervals and a hypothesis test on the maximum number of palindromes found in an interval.
- Wrote final report with visualizations and tables to analyze results and discuss limitations 
- R Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, knitr

### 2016-17 NBA Statistics
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/nba) | February - March 2018
- Used Principal Component Analysis, bootstrap/jackknife resampling, and random sampling simulations to calculate sample statistics, standard errors, correlations, and confidence intervals
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, including dataframe manipulations and visualizations
- R Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, readr, bootstrap
