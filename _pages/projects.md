## Predicting Well Functionality: Limitations of Survey Data
WellDone Data Science Intern | June 2018 - Present
- Train, apply, and evaluate machine learning models to improve well failure prediction accuracy by using alternative data sources
- Created extensive 30-page report that summarized methodology and findings for governments and aid organizations 

## Alameda County Food Insecurity
Berkeley Statistics Undergraduate Students Association Data Consultant | September - December 2017
- Analyzed social, economic, and demographic datasets to conduct exploratory data analysis and identify areas in need of hunger alleviation services
- Created multivariable predictive model to predict pounds unmet by census tract using Python and R
- Produced a variety of data visualizations including choropleth maps to present findings and investigate model accuracy using Tableau
- Conducted literature review, cleaned census data, and wrote final report and slides to develop future distribution and service strategies

## Personal/Class Projects

### Neural Networks
Python | August 2018
- Built neural networks from scratch to implement handwritten digit classification, language classification, and regression models
- Tuned hyperparameters to achieve 97.5% accuracy on digit classification, 81% on language classification, and loss of 0.0077 on sine curve regression

![Regression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hLuo27/hLuo27.github.io/master/files/cs188_neural_net/NN%20Regression%20Plot.png "Modelling Sine Curve")

### Pacman Agent
Python | June/July 2018
- Created collaborative agent that implemented A* search, minimax game trees, and reinforcement learning to play Pacman

### Classifying Legendary Pokémon
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/pokemon/blob/master/classify_legenday_pokemon_report.md) | May 2018
- Developed classifier to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary or not with 98.8% accuracy using k-nearest neighbours algorithm 
- R Packages: dplyr, ggplot2

### Predicting Child Heights from Parent Heights
Python/Jupyter Notebook | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/predict_heights) | April 2018
- Fitted data using linear regression, applied method of least squares, calculated correlation, standardized data units, and graphed residuals to evaluate applicability of linear regression model to predict heights of children given the heights of their parents
- Python packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, datascience

### Location of Palindromes in DNA Sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/DNA_palindromes) | March 2018
- Tested whether the placements of palindromes in the DNA sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus follows a Poisson distribution using a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test on the counts of palindromes in various intervals and a hypothesis test on the maximum number of palindromes found in an interval.
- Wrote final report with visualizations and tables to analyze results and discuss limitations 
- R Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, knitr

### 2016-17 NBA Statistics
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/nba) | February - March 2018
- Used Principal Component Analysis, bootstrap/jackknife resampling, and random sampling simulations to calculate sample statistics, standard errors, correlations, and confidence intervals
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, including dataframe manipulations and visualizations
- R Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, readr, bootstrap
