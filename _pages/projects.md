## Personal Projects

### BrokenBat Baseball Simulator Draft Analysis
Python | [Report](https:/hLuo27.github.io/files/BrokenBat_Draft_Report.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/hLuo27/broken_bat/tree/master/draft) | December 2018 - June 2020
- Scraping and analysis of 108,488 draft picks from 23 seasons based on various draft metrics in a baseball simulator

### BrokenBat Baseball Simulator Player Performance Modelling
Python | [Report](https://github.com/hLuo27/broken_bat/blob/master/player_performance/player_performance_report.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/hLuo27/broken_bat/tree/master/player_performance) | January 2019
-	Scraped player attributes and statistics from a baseball simulator (BrokenBat)
-	Developed and evaluated machine learning models to predict a batter's weighted on-base average (wOBA) and a pitcher's rate statistics (K/9, BB/9, HR/9) and Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) 
-	Applied models and analyze patterns among 900 players to create report explaining findings with actionable items for managers to boost player performance

### Location of Palindromes in DNA Sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus
R | [Link](https://github.com/hLuo27/DNA_palindromes/blob/master/dna_palindromes.md) | March 2018
- Tested whether the placements of palindromes in the DNA sequence of Human Cytomegalovirus follows a Poisson distribution using a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test on the counts of palindromes in various intervals and a hypothesis test on the maximum number of palindromes found in an interval.
- Wrote final report with visualizations and tables to analyze results and discuss limitations

### Asian Americans in Hockey
Writing | [Link](https://asianamericanhockey.home.blog)
- Profiles and updates on hockey players of Asian descent
